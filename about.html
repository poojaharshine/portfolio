            <h2>I'm Pooja Harshine</h2>
            <h3><b>
                Iâ€™m a dedicated student at PSNACET in Dindigul, with an enthusiastic
                approach to learning and a passion for creativity. I believe that true
                growth comes from a blend of education, personal interests, and real-world
                experiences. Books have always been my companions, allowing me to explore 
                new ideas, immerse myself in diverse perspectives, and fuel my creativity. 
                I enjoy reading a wide range of genres, each offering fresh insights and a 
                chance to reflect and expand my worldview.</b></h3>
                <h3><b>, on the other hand, are my chosen form of entertainment, 
                    combining relaxation with a love for visual storytelling. Each film,
                     with its unique narrative, brings forward new cultures, ideas, 
                     and emotions, helping me appreciate the diversity of human experience. I see movies as a beautiful medium to connect with universal
                     themes and be inspired by innovative ways to tell a story.</b></h3>
                    
                    
                     <h3><b> is another passion that shapes who I am. I love exploring new places and learning from the world around me. Every journey introduces me to new cultures, traditions, and landscapes, leaving me with valuable lessons and unforgettable memories. Travel fuels my curiosity and inspires me to think beyond boundaries, helping me develop a global perspective.

                    </b></h3>

                    <h3><b>In addition to my hobbies, I am actively involved in academic and creative projects. I thrive on merging curiosity with hands-on work, especially in areas like technology and design, where I can push boundaries and bring ideas to life. I believe in creating meaningful connections, sharing knowledge, and continuously learning to make a positive impact on the world. Through this portfolio, I am excited to share my journey, my ambitions, and the projects that define my path.
